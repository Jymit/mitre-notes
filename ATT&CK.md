MITRE ATT&CK is a highly detailed and cross-referenced repository of information about real-world adversary groups and their known behavior; the tactics, techniques, and procedures they use; specific instances of their activities; and the software and tools they employ

The ATT&CK Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. We've designed it to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques or anything else you want to do.
